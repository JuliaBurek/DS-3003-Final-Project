# DS-3003-Final-Project
For my final project, I explored Boston Marathon finishers data and built a shiny app with interactive plots to determine where finishers were from as well as average times by age and gender.

As a runner, running in the Boston Marathon would be a dream. I ran my first marathon this year, but did not qualify for the Boston Marathon. Because the Boston Marathon is world-renowned race, I wanted to explore just who makes up this elite race by looking at data on Boston Marathon Finishers for three different years. I created a world map as well as a United States map in order to see what countries and states a majority of finishers came from. I also created a scatter plot of average times by gender and age to determine if the finishing times were similar to the qualifying standards of the Boston Marathon. I utilized Shiny app features in order to make some of my plots interactive.
